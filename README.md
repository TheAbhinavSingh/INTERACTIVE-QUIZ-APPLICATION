*DESCRIPTION OF THIS TASK*:The Interactive Quiz Application is a simple yet effective web-based tool created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its main goal is to provide users with a fun and engaging way to test their knowledge on basic web development concepts. When you open the quiz, you’re greeted with a clean and centered interface that shows the current question and a list of multiple-choice answers. As soon as you click on an answer, the app immediately tells you if you were right or wrong by changing the color of the buttons—green for the correct answer and red for the wrong one. This instant feedback helps reinforce learning. The “Next” button then appears, allowing you to move on to the next question. This process continues until you've answered all five questions. Once you finish the quiz, the main quiz area disappears, and a result section shows up displaying your final score. What makes this quiz extra special is the certificate feature. After completing the quiz, you can click a button to download a certificate as a .txt file, which congratulates you on your performance and includes your score and the date. This is done using JavaScript’s file generation features, without needing any server or back-end system. The layout and design are handled by CSS, which gives the app a neat and professional look with features like shadows, rounded corners, and large, easy-to-read text and buttons. Everything is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Behind the scenes, JavaScript handles all the quiz logic, including loading questions, tracking the score, handling button clicks, and generating the final certificate. It uses basic DOM manipulation and event listeners to make the quiz feel dynamic and interactive. Overall, the app is a great example of how to build an interactive project using just front-end technologies. It’s perfect for internship tasks or learning projects because it covers a lot of core web development skills in a compact, user-friendly format. Whether you're a beginner practicing JavaScript or someone building a portfolio project, this quiz app is a great hands-on way to demonstrate what you’ve learned.
